## Updates

I'll keep updating the project to make the experience better for every user. If you have any ideas, feel free to fork, create pull request or suggest any changes.

## How to play

This game works just like a regular throw breaking practice in Tekken, but you don't need to open the game! As a user myself, I hope this project help you get better at Tekken!

Jin has 3 throw options here. Your objective is to recognize which hand his reaching out to grab Kazuya and react pressing the right key.

#### Throw with the left hand

You can break this throw by pressing 1 (in our game, the U key).

#### Throw with the right hand

You can break this throw by pressing 2 (in our game, the I key).

#### Throw with both hands

You can break this throw by pressing 1+2 (in our game, the O key).

##### Remember, practice makes perfect.
